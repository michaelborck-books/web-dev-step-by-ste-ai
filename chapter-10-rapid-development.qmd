# Rapid Development: CSS Frameworks {#sec-rapid-development}

## The Concept First

In @sec-presentation, you learned CSS from scratch—selectors, box model, flexbox, media queries. That foundation matters. But building every project from zero is slow, and consistency across large applications is hard.

**CSS frameworks** solve this by providing pre-built styles, components, and design decisions. Instead of designing every button, input, and card yourself, you adopt tested patterns that work together.

This isn't laziness—it's **leverage**. Professional developers use frameworks to move faster while maintaining quality. The skill is knowing when to use them, which to choose, and how to customise them for specific needs.

## Understanding Through Design Systems

Large organisations don't let every designer create their own button styles. They create **design systems**—documented collections of components, colours, typography, and patterns that ensure consistency.

Google has Material Design. Apple has Human Interface Guidelines. Salesforce has Lightning Design System. These define how interfaces should look and behave across products.

CSS frameworks are design systems you can adopt immediately:

- **Bootstrap**: Component-focused system with pre-built UI elements
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-focused system with building blocks for custom designs
- **Foundation**, **Bulma**, **Chakra UI**: Other popular options

Each makes different trade-offs. Understanding those trade-offs is how you choose wisely.

## Constraints Enable Speed
Paradoxically, constraints often speed up creative work. When you don't have to decide every colour, spacing, and font size, you can focus on structure and user experience. Frameworks provide productive constraints.

## Discovering Frameworks with Your AI Partner

### Exploration 1: Framework Philosophies

Bootstrap and Tailwind represent fundamentally different approaches:

```
Ask your AI:
Compare the philosophies behind Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS. Bootstrap
gives you pre-built components. Tailwind gives you utility classes.
When would you choose each approach? What are the trade-offs?
```

This should reveal:

**Bootstrap approach:**

- "Here's a button: `.btn .btn-primary`"
- Faster to start
- Consistent out of the box
- Can look generic without customisation

**Tailwind approach:**

- "Build your button: `bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded`"
- More markup
- Maximum flexibility
- Requires more design decisions

```
Continue the conversation:
I'm building a dashboard for a startup with tight deadlines. Which
framework would you recommend and why?
```

### Exploration 2: Constraints as Features

How do limitations help?

```
Ask your AI:
How do constraints help creativity? Apply this concept to CSS
frameworks. Why might having fewer choices actually improve outcomes?
```

Constraints reduce decision fatigue. When a framework says "primary buttons are this colour, secondary buttons are that colour," you're not spending mental energy on decisions that don't differentiate your product.

```
Continue the conversation:
When do framework constraints become limiting? At what point should
a project move away from a framework?
```

### Exploration 3: The "Generic" Problem

```
Ask your AI:
A client says their Bootstrap site "looks like every other Bootstrap
site." How would you respond? What can be done?
```

This reveals that frameworks are starting points, not endpoints. Customisation—colours, typography, spacing—transforms a generic framework site into something unique.

## From Concept to Code

Let's explore both Bootstrap and Tailwind practically.

### Bootstrap: Component-Based Framework

Bootstrap provides pre-styled components you assemble.

**Setup in HTML:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <title>Bootstrap Demo</title>
    <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Your content -->
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

**Buttons:**

```html
<button class="btn btn-primary">Primary</button>
<button class="btn btn-secondary">Secondary</button>
<button class="btn btn-outline-danger">Danger Outline</button>
<button class="btn btn-lg btn-success">Large Green</button>
```

**Cards:**

```html
<div class="card" style="width: 18rem;">
    <img src="image.jpg" class="card-img-top" alt="...">
    <div class="card-body">
        <h5 class="card-title">Card Title</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Some descriptive text here.</p>
        <a href="#" class="btn btn-primary">Learn More</a>
    </div>
</div>
```

**Grid System:**

```html
<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-4">Column 1</div>
        <div class="col-md-4">Column 2</div>
        <div class="col-md-4">Column 3</div>
    </div>
</div>
```

The grid is 12 columns wide. `col-md-4` means "4 columns wide on medium screens and up." On smaller screens, columns stack vertically.

**Responsive utilities:**

```html
<div class="d-none d-md-block">Hidden on mobile, visible on medium+</div>
<div class="d-block d-md-none">Visible on mobile, hidden on medium+</div>
```

```
Ask your AI:
I want a navigation bar that collapses into a hamburger menu on
mobile. Show me how to build this with Bootstrap.
```

### Tailwind CSS: Utility-First Framework

Tailwind provides low-level utility classes you combine.

**Setup (simplest via CDN for learning):**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <title>Tailwind Demo</title>
    <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Your content -->
</body>
</html>
```

::: {.callout-note}
## Production Setup
For production, install Tailwind via npm and build a custom CSS file. The CDN is for learning and prototyping only.
:::

**Buttons (you design them):**

```html
<button class="bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded hover:bg-blue-600">
    Primary Button
</button>

<button class="bg-gray-200 text-gray-800 px-4 py-2 rounded hover:bg-gray-300">
    Secondary Button
</button>

<button class="border border-red-500 text-red-500 px-4 py-2 rounded hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white">
    Danger Outline
</button>
```

**Understanding the classes:**

| Class | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `bg-blue-500` | Background colour (blue, shade 500) |
| `text-white` | Text colour white |
| `px-4` | Padding horizontal (left/right), size 4 |
| `py-2` | Padding vertical (top/bottom), size 2 |
| `rounded` | Border radius |
| `hover:bg-blue-600` | On hover, darker blue |

**Cards:**

```html
<div class="max-w-sm rounded overflow-hidden shadow-lg">
    <img class="w-full" src="image.jpg" alt="...">
    <div class="px-6 py-4">
        <h2 class="font-bold text-xl mb-2">Card Title</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 text-base">
            Some descriptive text here.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="px-6 pt-4 pb-2">
        <button class="bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded">
            Learn More
        </button>
    </div>
</div>
```

**Flexbox layout:**

```html
<div class="flex gap-4">
    <div class="flex-1 bg-gray-100 p-4">Column 1</div>
    <div class="flex-1 bg-gray-100 p-4">Column 2</div>
    <div class="flex-1 bg-gray-100 p-4">Column 3</div>
</div>
```

**Responsive design:**

```html
<!-- Single column on mobile, three columns on medium screens -->
<div class="flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-4">
    <div class="flex-1">Column 1</div>
    <div class="flex-1">Column 2</div>
    <div class="flex-1">Column 3</div>
</div>
```

Tailwind's breakpoint prefixes: `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`, `2xl:`.

```
Ask your AI:
Build me a responsive navigation bar with Tailwind that has a logo
on the left and links on the right, and stacks vertically on mobile.
```

### Using Frameworks with React

Both frameworks work well with React.

**Bootstrap with React:**

```bash
npm install bootstrap
```

```jsx
// In your main.jsx or App.jsx
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';

function ProductCard({ title, price }) {
    return (
        <div className="card" style={{ width: '18rem' }}>
            <div className="card-body">
                <h5 className="card-title">{title}</h5>
                <p className="card-text">${price}</p>
                <button className="btn btn-primary">Add to Cart</button>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

For components with JavaScript (modals, dropdowns), consider `react-bootstrap`:

```bash
npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap
```

```jsx
import Button from 'react-bootstrap/Button';
import Card from 'react-bootstrap/Card';

function ProductCard({ title, price }) {
    return (
        <Card style={{ width: '18rem' }}>
            <Card.Body>
                <Card.Title>{title}</Card.Title>
                <Card.Text>${price}</Card.Text>
                <Button variant="primary">Add to Cart</Button>
            </Card.Body>
        </Card>
    );
}
```

**Tailwind with React:**

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

Configure `tailwind.config.js`:

```javascript
export default {
    content: [
        "./index.html",
        "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
    ],
    theme: {
        extend: {},
    },
    plugins: [],
}
```

Add to your CSS file:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Use in components:

```jsx
function ProductCard({ title, price }) {
    return (
        <div className="max-w-sm rounded shadow-lg p-4">
            <h2 className="font-bold text-xl mb-2">{title}</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700">${price}</p>
            <button className="mt-4 bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded hover:bg-blue-600">
                Add to Cart
            </button>
        </div>
    );
}
```

### Customisation

**Bootstrap customisation** (via Sass):

```scss
// Override variables before importing Bootstrap
$primary: #your-brand-color;
$font-family-base: 'Your Font', sans-serif;
$border-radius: 0.5rem;

@import "bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

**Tailwind customisation** (via config):

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
export default {
    theme: {
        extend: {
            colors: {
                'brand': '#your-brand-color',
                'brand-dark': '#darker-version',
            },
            fontFamily: {
                'sans': ['Your Font', 'sans-serif'],
            },
        },
    },
}
```

Then use: `bg-brand`, `text-brand-dark`, etc.

## Building Your Mental Model

### The Abstraction Spectrum

```
More Abstraction                            Less Abstraction
(faster, less control)                      (slower, more control)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Component Libraries  →  Bootstrap  →  Tailwind  →  Custom CSS
(MUI, Chakra)           (pre-built)    (utilities)   (from scratch)
```

Move right for more control, left for more speed. Project needs determine the right position.

### When to Choose What

| Situation | Consider |
|-----------|----------|
| Rapid prototyping | Bootstrap or component library |
| Admin dashboards | Bootstrap (consistent patterns) |
| Marketing sites | Tailwind (unique designs) |
| Highly custom UI | Tailwind or custom CSS |
| Team with designers | Tailwind (matches design tokens) |
| Team without designers | Bootstrap (built-in design decisions) |
| Learning CSS | Start custom, add frameworks later |

### The Class Explosion Concern

Tailwind markup can look verbose:

```html
<button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded focus:outline-none focus:shadow-outline">
    Submit
</button>
```

Solutions:

1. **Extract components** (in React, this is natural)
2. **Use @apply in CSS** (creates reusable classes)
3. **Accept the trade-off** (markup complexity vs CSS complexity)

```
Ask your AI:
When does Tailwind's utility approach become unmanageable? How do
teams keep Tailwind codebases maintainable on large projects?
```

## Business Applications

### Development Speed

Frameworks dramatically reduce time-to-market:

- Pre-built responsive grids
- Tested browser compatibility
- Accessible components (often)
- Documentation and examples

What takes days in custom CSS takes hours with frameworks.

### Consistency at Scale

Large applications need consistent interfaces. Frameworks enforce consistency:

- All buttons look like buttons
- All cards have the same shadow
- Spacing follows a system
- Typography is unified

This consistency improves user experience and reduces maintenance.

### Team Efficiency

New team members can contribute faster when using standard frameworks:

- Well-documented
- Familiar patterns
- Searchable solutions online
- Reduced onboarding time

### Mobile-First by Default

Modern frameworks are mobile-responsive out of the box. Bootstrap's grid and Tailwind's responsive prefixes handle responsive design that would take significant custom CSS.

## ULO Connection
This develops **ULO 4** (selecting and integrating technologies) and **ULO 1** (effective web applications). Framework selection is a business decision—speed vs. customisation, team skills, project timeline. Professional judgment means choosing appropriately, not defaulting to what you know.

## Practice Exercises

::: {.callout-note}
## Exercise Levels
- **Level 1**: Direct application
- **Level 2**: Minor modifications
- **Level 3**: Combining concepts
- **Level 4**: Problem-solving
- **Level 5**: Open-ended design
:::

### Exercise 10.1: Bootstrap Basics (Level 1)

Create an HTML page using Bootstrap that includes:

1. A navigation bar with a brand name and three links
2. A hero section with a heading, paragraph, and button
3. A three-column grid of cards
4. A footer with centred text

Use only Bootstrap classes—no custom CSS.

### Exercise 10.2: Tailwind Basics (Level 2)

Recreate the same layout from Exercise 10.1 using Tailwind:

1. Navigation bar
2. Hero section
3. Three-column responsive grid
4. Footer

Compare the experience. Which felt faster? Which gave more control?

### Exercise 10.3: React + Framework (Level 3)

In a React project:

1. Choose either Bootstrap or Tailwind
2. Create a `ProductCard` component
3. Create a `ProductGrid` component that displays multiple cards
4. Make it responsive (single column on mobile, grid on desktop)
5. Add a "Featured" variant of the card with different styling

### Exercise 10.4: Customisation (Level 4)

Take your Exercise 10.3 project and customise the framework:

1. Change the primary colour to a custom brand colour
2. Adjust the border radius across components
3. Modify the default font family
4. Document the customisation process

Write 200 words explaining how customisation changes the "generic" feel.

### Exercise 10.5: Framework Recommendation (Level 5)

A startup is building a SaaS product dashboard. They have:

- Two developers (full-stack, not design-focused)
- Tight three-month deadline
- Need for admin panels, data tables, forms, charts
- Plans to hire a designer in six months

Write a 500-word recommendation:

1. Which framework would you recommend?
2. What's the trade-off they're accepting?
3. How should they approach customisation?
4. What happens when the designer arrives?
5. What alternatives did you consider?

## Chapter Summary

- CSS frameworks provide pre-built styles and design systems
- Bootstrap offers component-based development with pre-styled elements
- Tailwind offers utility-based development with maximum flexibility
- Both work well with React
- Framework choice depends on project needs, team skills, and timeline
- Customisation transforms generic frameworks into branded experiences

## Reflection

Before moving to Chapter 11, ensure you can:

- [ ] Explain the difference between component and utility frameworks
- [ ] Use Bootstrap to create responsive layouts and components
- [ ] Use Tailwind to style elements with utility classes
- [ ] Integrate either framework with React
- [ ] Customise framework colours, fonts, and spacing
- [ ] Articulate when to choose each framework

## Your Learning Journal

Record your responses to these prompts:

1. **Preference Exploration**: After trying both Bootstrap and Tailwind, which felt more natural to you? Why might someone prefer the other?

2. **Trade-off Analysis**: Think of a project you might build. Which framework would you choose and what trade-offs would you accept?

3. **AI Conversation Reflection**: What framework concept was hardest to grasp? What question to your AI partner helped clarify it?

4. **Professional Judgment**: A client asks "Why don't we just use custom CSS?" How would you respond?

## Next Steps

You now have tools for rapid, consistent UI development. But professional work requires more than just building features—it requires practices that ensure quality, collaboration, and maintainability.

In @sec-professional-practices, we'll cover version control with Git, testing basics, and code quality practices. These professional practices separate hobby projects from production-ready work and are expected in any development role.
