# Project: Business Website with WordPress {#sec-project-business-site}

## Project Overview

Part II taught you to think about content management strategically: when to use a CMS, how to evaluate platforms and plugins, and how WordPress architecture works. Now you'll apply that knowledge to build a complete business website.

This project simulates a real client engagement. You'll analyse requirements, make technology decisions, implement a solution, and document your choices professionally. The deliverables mirror what you'd provide to an actual client.

## Requirements

### Phase 1: Business Analysis

Before touching WordPress, complete:

**Business Case Document** (500-750 words):

1. **Business Overview**: What does this business do? What's their market position?
2. **Website Goals**: What should the website achieve? (leads, information, sales, community)
3. **Target Audience**: Who visits this site? What do they need?
4. **Success Metrics**: How will we know the website is working?

**Stakeholder Analysis**:

| Stakeholder | Needs | Concerns | Priority |
|-------------|-------|----------|----------|
| (e.g., Owner) | ... | ... | High/Med/Low |

**Content Strategy**:

- What content types are needed?
- Who creates and maintains each type?
- How often does each type update?
- What's the approval workflow?

**Site Map**:

Create a visual or text-based site map showing:

- All pages and their hierarchy
- Content types and relationships
- Navigation structure

### Phase 2: Technology Decisions

Document your decisions with justification:

**Theme Selection**:

- Evaluate at least three themes
- Document criteria and scores
- Justify your final selection
- Note any limitations you'll work around

**Plugin Selection**:

For each functional requirement, document:

- The need it addresses
- Options you evaluated
- Your selection and why
- Any concerns or trade-offs

**Minimum plugins to evaluate:**

- Contact forms (e.g., WPForms, Contact Form 7, Gravity Forms)
- SEO (e.g., Yoast, RankMath)
- Security (e.g., Wordfence, Sucuri)
- Backup (e.g., UpdraftPlus)
- Any scenario-specific needs

2. **Theme information** (name, version, any modifications)
3. **Plugin inventory** (name, purpose, configuration notes)
4. **Content management guide** (how to add/edit content types)
5. **Maintenance recommendations** (backups, updates, security)

## AI Collaboration Guidelines

### How to Use AI Effectively

Use AI as a consultant you're learning from:

```
Ask your AI:
I'm choosing between Theme A and Theme B for a café website. Here's
what I know about each... Help me think through the decision. What
factors might I be missing?
```

```
Ask your AI:
I need to customise the footer in my child theme to include business
hours. Walk me through how to do this safely, and explain each step
so I understand what I'm doing.
```

### Documentation Requirements

Keep an AI collaboration log documenting:

1. **Technology decisions**: How did AI help evaluate options?
2. **Implementation challenges**: What problems did you solve with AI help?
3. **Modifications**: How did you adapt AI suggestions?
4. **Learning moments**: What did you understand better after AI conversation?

### Client Recommendation

Write a summary (300-400 words) as if presenting to the client:

- What did you build and why?
- What are the key features?
- How do they manage content?
- What ongoing maintenance is needed?
- What future enhancements might they consider?

5. **Recommendations and reflection** (PDF): Client recommendation + AI collaboration log

## Getting Started

Begin with these conversations with your AI partner:

```
Ask your AI:
I'm building a WordPress site for [your scenario]. Help me think
through what questions I should be asking in the business analysis
phase. What do I need to understand before making technology decisions?
```

```
Ask your AI:
For a [type of business] website, what are the essential plugins I
should consider? Not just what's popular, but what this specific
type of business actually needs.
```

```
Ask your AI:
I'm writing a handover document for a client. What should it include
so they can manage their WordPress site independently? What do
non-technical clients most need to know?
```

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Skipping business analysis**: Jumping to WordPress without understanding requirements leads to rework
2. **Over-complicating**: Installing 20 plugins when 5 would suffice
3. **Using placeholder content**: "Lorem ipsum" signals incomplete work
4. **Ignoring mobile**: Always test responsive behaviour
5. **No documentation**: A site without documentation isn't ready for handover
6. **Copying AI output blindly**: AI helps you understand—you make the decisions
7. **Forgetting security**: Security and backup plugins are non-negotiable

## Professional Context

This project mirrors real WordPress consulting work:

1. **Discovery**: Understanding business needs before proposing solutions
2. **Recommendation**: Evaluating options and justifying choices
3. **Implementation**: Building the solution professionally
4. **Handover**: Documenting for ongoing maintenance

These skills are directly applicable to freelance work, agency positions, or managing WordPress sites in any organisation.

## After Submission

Your WordPress project demonstrates:

- Business analysis skills
- Technology evaluation and decision-making
- Practical WordPress implementation
- Professional documentation

Consider these as portfolio pieces—they show employers you can think beyond just code.
