# Project: React Integration {#sec-project-react-integration}

## Project Overview

Part III taught you component thinking, CSS frameworks, and professional practices. Now you'll bring it together: build a React frontend that consumes content from WordPress via the REST API, demonstrating headless architecture in action.

This project bridges backend content management with modern frontend development. You'll make architectural decisions, implement a complete application, and document your approach—skills that directly translate to professional frontend development roles.

**Aligned with**: Assessment 3 in ISYS3004

## Learning Outcomes Addressed

- **ULO 1**: Design and implement effective web applications
- **ULO 4**: Select and integrate appropriate technologies
- **ULO 5**: Evaluate emerging technologies and approaches

## Technical Context

In @sec-headless-architecture, you learned that headless WordPress separates content management (WordPress) from content presentation (your frontend). This project implements that architecture:

```
┌────────────────┐     REST API     ┌────────────────┐
│   WordPress    │ ───────────────► │   React App    │
│   (Backend)    │    JSON Data     │   (Frontend)   │
│                │                  │                │
│ - Content      │                  │ - Components   │
│ - Media        │                  │ - Styling      │
│ - Users        │                  │ - Routing      │
└────────────────┘                  └────────────────┘
```

Your React application will fetch and display content that's managed in WordPress—the same content model used by major publishers, e-commerce sites, and enterprise applications.

## Project Scenarios

Choose one scenario that builds on your WordPress site from the Business Site Project, or create new content:

### Option A: Blog Frontend

Transform your WordPress blog into a modern React single-page application:

- Post listing with categories
- Individual post pages
- Author information display
- Search functionality
- Category filtering

### Option B: Portfolio Showcase

Display portfolio items or projects from WordPress:

- Grid/list view of projects
- Project detail pages with images
- Category or technology filtering
- Contact form integration

### Option C: Business Directory

Create a directory interface for business listings:

- Searchable listing grid
- Individual business pages
- Location or category filtering
- Featured listings section

### Option D: Custom Application

Propose your own application that:

- Consumes WordPress REST API content
- Has at least two distinct views (list and detail)
- Includes meaningful filtering or search
- Demonstrates component architecture

## Requirements

### Phase 1: Planning and Setup

Before writing code, document your approach:

**Application Design Document** (300-500 words):

1. **Scenario Overview**: Which scenario did you choose and why?
2. **Component Architecture**: What components will you need? Draw a component tree.
3. **Data Requirements**: What WordPress content will you fetch? What endpoints?
4. **User Interface**: Sketch or describe the main views
5. **Technology Choices**: Which CSS framework? Why?

**Component Tree Example:**

```
App
├── Header
│   ├── Logo
│   └── Navigation
├── Main
│   ├── PostList (or)
│   │   └── PostCard (×n)
│   └── PostDetail
│       ├── PostContent
│       └── AuthorInfo
└── Footer
```

### Phase 2: React Implementation

Build the application with these requirements:

**Core Setup:**

- [ ] React project created with Vite
- [ ] Git repository initialised
- [ ] CSS framework installed and configured
- [ ] Project structure organised logically
- [ ] README with setup instructions

**Component Architecture:**

- [ ] At least 5 distinct components
- [ ] Proper use of props for data passing
- [ ] State management with useState
- [ ] Side effects with useEffect
- [ ] Components are reusable where appropriate

**WordPress Integration:**

- [ ] Fetch posts from WordPress REST API
- [ ] Handle loading states (spinner, skeleton, or message)
- [ ] Handle error states gracefully
- [ ] Display at least 3 post fields (title, content, excerpt, author, date, etc.)
- [ ] Images loaded from WordPress media

**User Interface:**

- [ ] List view showing multiple items
- [ ] Detail view showing single item
- [ ] Navigation between views (useState or React Router)
- [ ] Responsive design (works on mobile and desktop)
- [ ] Consistent styling with chosen CSS framework

**Professional Practices:**

- [ ] Meaningful Git commits throughout development
- [ ] Code formatted consistently (Prettier recommended)
- [ ] No console errors or warnings in final version

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features

Implement at least TWO of the following:

**Search/Filter:**

- [ ] Search posts by title or content
- [ ] Filter by category or tag
- [ ] Clear filters to show all

**Pagination:**

- [ ] Load more posts on demand
- [ ] Or implement traditional pagination
- [ ] Handle edge cases (no more posts, first page)

**Routing:**

- [ ] React Router for URL-based navigation
- [ ] Direct links to individual posts
- [ ] Back navigation works correctly

**Additional Content:**

- [ ] Display WordPress pages (not just posts)
- [ ] Show author information with avatar
- [ ] Display featured images properly

### Phase 4: Documentation and Reflection

**Technical Documentation:**

Create a README.md that includes:

1. **Project Description**: What the application does
2. **Setup Instructions**: How to run locally
3. **WordPress Configuration**: Required WordPress setup
4. **Architecture Overview**: How components fit together
5. **API Endpoints Used**: Which WordPress endpoints and why

**Reflection Document** (500-700 words):

1. **Headless Architecture**: What are the advantages and disadvantages of this approach compared to traditional WordPress themes?

2. **Component Decisions**: Describe two components you created. Why did you structure them that way? What data do they receive and display?

3. **State Management**: Where does state live in your application? Why did you put it there?

4. **Challenges and Solutions**: What was the hardest part of this project? How did you solve it?

5. **Future Improvements**: If you had more time, what would you add or change?

## AI Collaboration Guidelines

### Effective AI Partnership

Use AI as a thinking partner, not a code generator:

```
Ask your AI:
I'm fetching WordPress posts but the featured images aren't showing.
Here's my code... Help me understand what's happening. What am I
missing about how WordPress returns image data?
```

```
Ask your AI:
I have a PostList component and a PostDetail component. When the user
clicks a post, I need to show the detail. What are my options for
handling this navigation? Walk me through the trade-offs.
```

```
Ask your AI:
My component is getting complex with loading, error, and data states.
Is there a pattern for handling this more cleanly? Show me options
and explain when each makes sense.
```

### AI Collaboration Log

Document your AI interactions:

| Challenge | Question Asked | AI Response Summary | How I Applied It |
|-----------|---------------|---------------------|------------------|
| (e.g., Images not loading) | ... | ... | ... |

For each significant interaction:

1. What problem were you solving?
2. What did you ask?
3. What did the AI explain?
4. How did you adapt the suggestion to your specific situation?
5. What did you learn that you'll use again?

### Attribution Requirements

Be clear about AI involvement:

- Code you wrote yourself vs. code adapted from AI suggestions
- Concepts you learned through AI conversation
- Documentation created with AI assistance

This isn't about restricting AI use—it's about demonstrating that you **understood** what you built.

## Getting Started

Begin with these conversations:

```
Ask your AI:
I'm building a React app that fetches WordPress posts. What's the
basic structure I should start with? Walk me through the component
hierarchy and data flow.
```

```
Ask your AI:
In a React app, I need to show a list of posts and then show details
when one is clicked. What are my options for handling this without
React Router? Explain the useState approach.
```

```
Ask your AI:
My WordPress site is at [URL]. What does the REST API endpoint for
posts look like? How do I get featured images included?
```

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Skipping the plan**: Jumping into code without designing component architecture leads to refactoring
2. **One giant component**: Put everything in App.js instead of breaking into focused components
3. **Ignoring loading states**: App breaks or shows nothing while data loads
4. **No error handling**: App crashes when API fails instead of showing helpful message
5. **Props drilling confusion**: Not understanding where state should live
6. **Not using keys in lists**: Causes warnings and potential bugs
7. **Committing node_modules**: Makes repository huge and unusable
8. **Hardcoded URLs**: API endpoints should be configurable or documented

## Technical Tips

**Fetching WordPress posts with featured images:**

```javascript
// Include _embed to get featured media data
const response = await fetch(
    'http://your-site.local/wp-json/wp/v2/posts?_embed'
);
const posts = await response.json();

// Access featured image URL
const imageUrl = post._embedded?.['wp:featuredmedia']?.[0]?.source_url;
```

**Project structure suggestion:**

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── Header.jsx
│   ├── PostCard.jsx
│   ├── PostList.jsx
│   ├── PostDetail.jsx
│   └── LoadingSpinner.jsx
├── App.jsx
├── main.jsx
└── index.css
```

**useState for view navigation:**

```javascript
const [selectedPost, setSelectedPost] = useState(null);

// In render
{selectedPost ? (
    <PostDetail post={selectedPost} onBack={() => setSelectedPost(null)} />
) : (
    <PostList posts={posts} onSelectPost={setSelectedPost} />
)}
```

## Professional Context

This project demonstrates skills employers look for:

1. **Frontend architecture**: Structuring React applications logically
2. **API integration**: Working with external data sources
3. **State management**: Handling application data flow
4. **User experience**: Loading states, error handling, responsive design
5. **Professional practices**: Version control, documentation, code quality

Headless architecture is increasingly common in enterprise development. Understanding how to build frontends that consume APIs—whether WordPress, a custom backend, or third-party services—is valuable regardless of your eventual specialisation.

## After Submission

This project, combined with your WordPress Business Site, demonstrates full-stack thinking:

- Backend: WordPress content management
- API: REST interface design
- Frontend: React component architecture
- Professional: Version control, documentation, testing

Consider extending this portfolio piece by:

- Adding more interactive features
- Implementing React Router for proper URLs
- Adding tests with Vitest
- Deploying to a hosting service

These extensions show initiative and technical depth to potential employers.
