    "text": "Building for Business in the AI Era\nWelcome to Web Development Step by Step: Building Business Solutions with AI – a practical guide to modern web development that embraces AI as your development partner while never losing sight of why we build: to solve real business problems.\n\nWhy This Book Is Different\nMost web development books teach you technologies. This book teaches you to think like a professional developer who happens to use specific technologies.\nIn a world where AI can generate code in seconds, the valuable skills are:\n\nUnderstanding what to build – translating business needs into technical requirements\nEvaluating technology choices – knowing when WordPress beats React, or vice versa\nCommunicating with stakeholders – explaining technical decisions in business terms\nIteratively improving – knowing when “good enough” ships and when quality matters\n\nThis book develops these skills while teaching you HTML, CSS, JavaScript, WordPress, and React.\n\n\nThe AI Partnership\nAI can write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript faster than you ever will. That’s not a threat – it’s a superpower.\nThis book teaches you to:\n\nArchitect solutions that AI helps you build\nEvaluate AI output with professional judgment\nCommunicate requirements clearly enough for AI to help\nDebug and improve AI-generated code\n\nYou’re learning to be the architect. AI is your highly skilled assistant.\n\n\nAbout This Book’s Creation\nIn the spirit of practicing what we teach, this book was created through human-AI collaboration. Every chapter represents a partnership between human expertise and AI assistance, with careful human oversight ensuring pedagogical quality and technical accuracy.\n\n\nYour Learning Journey\nOver 12 weeks (or at your own pace), you’ll progress from understanding web fundamentals to building integrated business applications. More importantly, you’ll develop the professional judgment that makes you valuable in any technology stack.\n\n\nWho This Book Is For\n\nStudents in business technology or web development courses\nCareer changers entering tech from business backgrounds\nProfessionals who need to understand web development for their roles\nAnyone who wants to build web solutions with AI assistance\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\nBasic computer literacy\nCuriosity about how websites work\nWillingness to experiment and learn from mistakes\nAccess to AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, or similar)\n\nNo prior programming experience required. We start from scratch.\n\n\nHow to Use This Book\nEach chapter follows a consistent pattern:\n\nConcept First – Understand the idea before the syntax\nAI Exploration – Discover patterns with AI assistance\nHands-On Practice – Build something real\nBusiness Connection – Understand why this matters\nReflection – Consolidate your learning\n\nWork through chapters in order. Each builds on the previous.\n\n\nCompanion Course\nThis book aligns with ISYS3004: Business Web and Mobile Technologies at Curtin University, but stands alone as a complete learning resource.",

So why learn web development at all?\nHere’s the truth: AI is incredible at writing code, but it doesn’t understand what your business needs. You’re the architect, the translator between business requirements and technical solutions. AI is your highly skilled assistant who needs clear direction.\nThis book teaches you to be that architect.",

    "text": "1.2 The Partnership Experiment\nLet’s discover how AI really works as a web development partner. This experiment will shape how you learn throughout this book.\n\nRound 1: The Vague Request\nOpen your AI assistant (ChatGPT, Claude, or whatever you’re using). Type this exactly:\nMake a website\nWhat did you get? The AI probably asked questions or made assumptions. This is your first lesson: AI needs direction.\n\n\nRound 2: The Simple Request\nNow try:\nMake a business website\nYou likely got a massive amount of HTML, CSS, maybe JavaScript – a complete but generic template. This is AI’s default: give you everything at once.\n\n\nRound 3: The Learning Request\nNow try:\nI'm learning web development. Show me the absolute simplest HTML page that displays a business name and tagline. Nothing else.\nYou might get:\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;meta charset=\"UTF-8\"&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;My Business&lt;/title&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;h1&gt;Sunrise Café&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Fresh coffee, warm welcome&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\nMuch clearer! AI responds to your learning needs when you express them clearly.\n\n\nRound 4: The Concept Request\nFinally, try:\nExplain how a web page is structured, using a building analogy, before showing any code\nNow you’re using AI to build understanding, not just generate code.",

    "text": "1.4 The Three Learning Strategies\nThroughout this book, we’ll follow three core strategies:\n\nStrategy 1: Understand the Concept Before the Code\nEvery web development task follows patterns. Understand the pattern first, then learn how HTML/CSS/JavaScript expresses it.\nExample: Don’t ask “How do I make a navigation menu?” Instead, ask “What is the purpose of navigation on a website?” Then, “Show me the simplest HTML navigation.”\n\n\nStrategy 2: Use AI to Explore, Not to Avoid Learning\nAI is your exploration tool. Use it to:\n\nSee different approaches to the same problem\nUnderstand why code works\nCompare technologies\nDebug your understanding\n\n\n\nStrategy 3: Build Mental Models, Not Just Working Websites\nA working website isn’t the goal. Understanding how and why it works is. Use AI to build these mental models.\nExample: Ask “Draw a diagram showing how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together” or “Explain responsive design using a newspaper analogy.”",

Why?\n\n\nExercise 0.3: AI Comparison (Level 3)\nAsk the same question to two different AI tools (or the same tool twice). Compare the responses. What’s consistent? What differs? What does this tell you about using AI?\n\n\nExercise 0.4: Business Translation (Level 4)\nA client says: “I want a website that looks professional and works on phones.”\nWrite three different AI prompts that would help you: 1. Clarify what “professional” means 2. Understand their mobile requirements 3. Explore technology options\n\n\nExercise 0.5: AI Learning Plan (Level 5)\nDesign your personal AI learning strategy for this book: 1. What kinds of prompts will you start with? 2.
